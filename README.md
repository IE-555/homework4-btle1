# Homework 4 (Data Visualization)

Dear IE 459/555 Students,

As we've discussed in class, we will be peer-evaluating Homework 4 (data visualization) in class on Monday, Nov. 6 and Wednesday, Nov. 8.  

Some important info:
1. Upload your Jupyter notebook **before class** on Monday, Nov. 6.
    - Use `sample_hw4.ipynb` as a template/example 
    - Be sure to rename the Jupyter notebook, replacing `sample` with your UB userID.  For example, my Jupyter notebook would be renamed `cmurray3_hw4.ipynb`.
    - Remove `sample_hw4.ipynb` from the repo...there should only be **one** `.ipynb` file.  Otherwise, your repo will be cluttered with unnecessary files.
2. There is **no auto-grader** for this assignment.  Again, we will be peer-evaluating in class.  At the beginning of class I will assign you a partner and will explain how to give your partner access to your repo.
    - Make sure you show up on time so you can hear the instructions.
3. You must attend both classes (November 6th and 8th) to receive credit for this assignment.
